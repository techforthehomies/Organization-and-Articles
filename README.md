## Short Blurb
Our technological overlords are whack! I'm tired of seeing brilliant creators, particular from marginalizd backgrounds (my homies), put out amazing work and get mistreated in return. This project is a call to action for people to start saving and sharing their own content, and to be more security concious in general. I write useful guides and informative articles, and I'm working on cool tech projects with this philosophy in mind. Check 'em out!
